## 🖐 Requirements

**Minimum environment requirements**

- Node.js `>=20.0.0`
- NPM `>=10.x.x`

## 🔧 Configuration

### Settings page

Use the settings page to configure the plugin.

- **Enable content types:** Select for which content types the plugin should be available.

For each selected content type, you have the following settings:

- **Default URL Alias field:** Select a field from which the slug will automatically be generated. For example, use the 'title' field or a dedicated slug field.
- **URL Alias pattern:** Create a default pattern for the slug. For example, when creating a 'news' content type and you want your url structure to be like '/news/some-title' for all entities, enter 'news' in this setting field. The slug will automatically be appended to this string.
- **URL Alias API field:** Allows you to append the current URL (slug) of an entity to a specific field. This is especially useful when working with components like a "teaser"—for example, you can store the slug in a hidden field within the teaser component. This way, you can fetch just the teaser via the API while still having access to its full URL.
